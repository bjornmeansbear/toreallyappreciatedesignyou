to really appreciate design you...
==================================

this was created as a “poster” for a visiting artist workshop with andrew blauvelt. Originally, this was a hacked together Drupal site. Now it is a static remnant that uses a simple JSON array and some javascript to pull a random design statement out of the hat. When the site was powered by Drupal anyone that visited could add a new completion phrase… this functionality may return. 

for now though, this is a nice relic.

from 2009 and onward.
